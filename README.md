# Kid-pawn, a very simple chess program

This is an extremely weak, but playable, chess program.  It understands no strategy, but tries its hardest to protect its pieces, take yours, and end up with more material.  It can beat you if you underestimate it.

I wrote it to help my daughter, who's learning chess.  The other online chess programs she plays are reasonably strategic, but make stupid mistakes, like not completing a trade after she takes a protected piece.  She was learning to take advantage of this tendency.  In constrast, this player never makes "stupid" mistakes, but will behave randomly if it doesn't see a clear material advantage to any move.
